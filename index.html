			The article I chose to write about was an article addressing rumors of the UK’s capital, London, being moved to a different location (as well as Bristol and Hull, but the focus is London). I was surprised to hear this, personally I could not imagine any other city as the capital over there (granted I do not live there, but still!). The “Expert” that was presenting the idea brought up a very good point, global warming! Rising sea levels across the globe have prompted the potential change in capital from London to a city further inland, as these rising sea levels could render the coastal cities in the UK uninhabitable in the coming years. The article mentioned Indonesia, who had already moved their capital for the same exact reason as the one presented here, mass flooding, rising sea levels, etc. After this the article takes advantage and brings up the impact of global warming on the global economy as a whole, and talks briefly on many problems like food, migration, climate change, and threatened coastal cities everywhere.

			This is insanely shocking to hear about and this really does put in perspective how out of hand things are getting with the global warming crisis and climate change.  I do not really watch the news often, but when I do it is typically only local news about football/baseball games, weather, etc. This is the first real time I have seen another country addressing this issue, this being said I never went and looked for it specifically, but it is shocking to see nonetheless.

        <p>Chris Doyle’s Article on “ Liverpool 3-2 AC Milan: Jordan Henderson's stunner seals comeback win” . Liverpool started their Champions League journey with an incredible performance securing three points against AC Milan. </p>
        <p>The classic champions league match had the remenision vibes of the 2005 finals, where the Reds had pulled out one of the best comeback of Champions League history. Like the previous cinderella story where Liverpool were inspired by the captain Steven Gerrad’s leadership skills, this match was also ignited by the amazing skills and leadership demonstrated by the captain Jordan Henderson.
        </p>
        <p>Trent Alexander-Arnold helped fire the Reds in front as his deflected effort, which went down as a Fikayo Tomori own goal, gave them a well-deserved lead.But after Mohamed Salah failed to convert a spot-kick to double their advantage, the Serie A side showed their fighting spirit. AC Milan scored two quick-fire goals with their first two shots of the game and turned the tide. Ante Rebic equalised for the Serie A side before Brahim Diaz sensationally gave the Italians the lead. It was a truly action-pack wild five minutes of the end of the first half. 
        </p>
        <p>Salah had an opportunity in the first half to double their lead to 2-0 from the spot kick but his kick was well read and saved by Maigan as Liverpool squandered the opportunity to take a two-goal lead early on. But he redeemed himself later on as he equalised for Jurgen Klopp's men to make it 2-2.
        </p>
        <p>The Captain Henderson fired Liverpool back in front with a thunderbolt of a finish in the second half to make it 3-2. The ball fell to the captain on the edge of the box and he stuck it sweetly on the half volley as it nestled into the bottom corner. The goal was a great representation to show how marvelous encounter with both teams goes in the Champions league.
        </p>
        <p>AC Millian had qualified for the Champions league first time since 2013-14 season and they had shown some beautiful team spirits and plays. But the brutal fast pace tactics of Liverpool had earned them the deserving victory.
