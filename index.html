			The article I chose to write about was an article addressing rumors of the UK’s capital, London, being moved to a different location (as well as Bristol and Hull, but the focus is London). I was surprised to hear this, personally I could not imagine any other city as the capital over there (granted I do not live there, but still!). The “Expert” that was presenting the idea brought up a very good point, global warming! Rising sea levels across the globe have prompted the potential change in capital from London to a city further inland, as these rising sea levels could render the coastal cities in the UK uninhabitable in the coming years. The article mentioned Indonesia, who had already moved their capital for the same exact reason as the one presented here, mass flooding, rising sea levels, etc. After this the article takes advantage and brings up the impact of global warming on the global economy as a whole, and talks briefly on many problems like food, migration, climate change, and threatened coastal cities everywhere.

			This is insanely shocking to hear about and this really does put in perspective how out of hand things are getting with the global warming crisis and climate change.  I do not really watch the news often, but when I do it is typically only local news about football/baseball games, weather, etc. This is the first real time I have seen another country addressing this issue, this being said I never went and looked for it specifically, but it is shocking to see nonetheless.
